/*
ðŸ§  What is a Worker Pool?
Itâ€™s a pattern where:

You have a set number of workers (goroutines)

# You send them tasks through a channel

# Each worker picks up and processes a task

The main program waits until all tasks are done âœ…

This is great for:

CPU-bound or IO-bound tasks (e.g. file processing, API calls)

Controlling goroutine usage to avoid overwhelming resources

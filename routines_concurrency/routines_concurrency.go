/*
Go was built for concurrency. This means your program can do many things at once â€” without complex thread management like in Java or C++.

ðŸ§  What is a Goroutine?
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

You create a goroutine using the go keyword:

go doSomething()
While main() is running, this doSomething() function runs in the background.
